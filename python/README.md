In Python, there's a distinction:

- **Built-in functions** are functions like `print()`, `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, etc. that are available globally
- **Module functions** are functions that belong to a specific module and must be imported before use.
- **Methods** are functions that belong to specific objects/classes, like `list.append()`, `set.add()`, `dict.keys()`, etc.
